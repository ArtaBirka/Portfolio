<h2>Layout</h2>

<p> Originally there were 3 different ideas for the layout. This website was designed for families, that is why I went with the first one. The visualisation is the first thing the user sees and it is suited for all ages because it is easy to comprehend. Under the image the available classes are listed going from the least to most expensive so it is easy to follow along. Most warning  information is displayed in bold big text under all the content.</p>

<h2>Photoshop</h2>

<p>To create a visualisation of the trip accurately I decided to include the activities alongside the map of the trip itself. I did this by taking different images of the activities, destinations and transportation and cutting out the most important parts. I made edits to the lighting and colors and then put them together. </p>
